# Cartel-detection in Rational Complex Networks
This repository contains the code used in my [C5.4 Networks](https://courses-archive.maths.ox.ac.uk/node/49460) final assessment, the paper of which can be found [here](www.jacobussmit.com) (when released).

To run the code, please install [Julia 1.7.X or above](https://julialang.org/downloads/), open the repository in your text editor of choice, and run the following commands to install the required packages:
```
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()
```

Now the code from `src` can be run. Files beginning with `plot` produce plots included in the paper.
